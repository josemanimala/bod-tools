Description:

Autobod is a script to autmate the .Bod building process for the Bodhilinux Operating System. Bod files
are a self executable collection of .deb files created using makeself and clever bash scripting created
by Jeff Hoogland. More information about bods and bodhilinux can be found at http://www.bodhilinux.com


Installation:

You will need both the autobod script and the installer

- Put the autobod script into /usr/bin - cp autobod /usr/bin
- Change permissions to make the script executable - chmod 755 /usr/bin/autobod
- Create a 'working' folder eg - mkdir bod-build
- put the installer script into the 'working' folder - cp installer /bod-build


usage:

The script needs to be run as root.

sudo autobod <appname> <appcat> <appdesc>

Where 
<appname> is the name of the application/package ie firefox
<appcat> is the menu in applications where the appliaction will be accesed from ie internet
<appdesc> is the brief description of the application ie web browser


To be implemented:

- ncurses support
- wrapper script to enable batch conversion
- clean up command to clean up ie autoremove, autoclean, purge, to leave the session in a 'clean/fresh'
state in order to be able to succesfully continue building more bods.


NOTE

Bods need to be built on an entirly fresh install, or a live environment which hasn't been upgraded, and on which nothing is installed other than makeself.

sudo apt-get update needs to be run to refresh the package list.
